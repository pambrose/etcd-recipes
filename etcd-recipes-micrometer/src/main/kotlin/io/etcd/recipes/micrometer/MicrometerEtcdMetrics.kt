/**
 * A Micrometer-backed [EtcdMetrics]. Install it on any recipe with
 * `ResilienceConfig.withMetrics(MicrometerEtcdMetrics(registry))`.
 *
 * Meters registered (all sharing whatever common tags [registry] carries):
 * - `etcd.rpc` — a [Timer] per blocking RPC, tagged `operation` (the op name without its key
 *   argument) and `outcome` (`success`/`failure`);
 * - `etcd.rpc.retries` — a counter of extra attempts beyond the first, tagged `operation`;
 * - `etcd.watch.recovery` — a counter of resilient-watcher transitions, tagged `kind`;
 * - `etcd.keepalive` — a counter of self-healing-lease events, tagged `kind`;
 * - `etcd.lock.wait` — a [Timer] of lock/permit acquisition waits, tagged `outcome`
 *   (`acquired`/`timeout`);
 * - `etcd.lock.hold` — a [Timer] of lock/permit hold durations;
 * - `etcd.election.transitions` — a counter of leadership changes, tagged `transition`
 *   (`acquired`/`relinquished`).
 *
 * Tag cardinality is kept low on purpose: the etcd key, lock path, and lease id are used only
 * for the (low-cardinality) `operation`/`kind`/`outcome` dimensions, never as tags themselves.
